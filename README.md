A simple web-based BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to enter their height and weight to calculate their BMI and determine their weight status (underweight, normal weight, or overweight) based on the result.

## Features

- Provides a weight guide for BMI categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage and making it visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the logic of BMI calculation and form validation.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter your height in centimeters and weight in kilograms into the corresponding input fields.
3. Click the "Calculate" button to calculate your BMI.
4. The result will display your BMI and categorize it as either:
   - Underweight (BMI < 18.6)
   - Normal Range (18.6 <= BMI <= 24.9)
   - Overweight (BMI > 24.9)
5. Below the result, you will also see a BMI weight guide.
